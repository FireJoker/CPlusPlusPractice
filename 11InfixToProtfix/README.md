# Infix to Postfix Expression Converter
This C++ program converts an infix expression to a postfix expression using a stack. In a postfix expression, operators appear after their operands, whereas in an infix expression, they appear between their operands. The program processes the symbols in the postfix expression one by one, saving operators in a stack until they are needed. It handles basic operators such as +, -, *, /, (, ), and the exponentiation operator ^^^.

## Algorithm Overview
The algorithm for converting from infix to postfix notation is as follows:

- Initialize an operator stack, **`s`**.
- While not at the end of the infix expression, do the following:
    - If the symbol is an operand, write the operand.
    - If the symbol is **`(`**, push **`)`** onto **`s`**.
    - If the symbol is **`)`**, pop and write all operators until encountering **`(`**, then pop **`(`**.
    - If the symbol is **`*`** or **`/`**, pop and write all **`*`** and **`/`** operators from the top down to, but not including, the top-most **`(`**, **`+`** or **`-`** or to the bottom of the stack. Push the new symbol, **`*`** or **`/`**.
    - If the symbol is **`+`** or **`-`**, pop and write all operators from the top down to, but not including, the topmost **`(`** or to the bottom of the stack. Push the new symbol, **`+`** or **`-`**.
    - At the end of the expression, pop and write all remaining operators.
