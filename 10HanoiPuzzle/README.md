# Tower of Hanoi Puzzle Solver
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883.   
In this puzzle, we are given a tower of disks, initially stacked in increasing size on one of three pegs.   
The goal is to transfer the entire tower to one of the other pegs, following these rules:  

- Move only one disk at a time.
- Never place a larger disk onto a smaller one.

## Program Description
This C++ program creatively solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The user can input the number of disks they want to use in the puzzle.   
The program then displays the steps to solve the puzzle, using recursion to move the disks between the pegs.
