# Snake Game in C++
This is a console-based implementation of the classic Snake game in C++. The game allows you to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The goal is to avoid running into the walls or the snake's own tail. The snake's length increases each time it eats food, and the game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
